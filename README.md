# Image Captions Creator

## Overview

Image Captions Creator is an application that uses ChatGPT to automatically generate descriptive captions for images. It processes each image in a specified directory and saves the generated captions as text files with corresponding names.

## Usage

- Windows: run `run.cmd`.
- Mac: run `run.bash`.

On first launch, the script installs necessary dependencies and creates a default `settings.json` file if it doesn't exist. Customize this file by specifying the directory for your images, your OpenAI API key, and a prompt (if desired, or use the default).

Note: This tool utilizes the OpenAI API, which may have associated limitations and costs. Please be aware of these when using the application.
